<a href="https://www.shirin-glander.de">Shiny app by Dr. Shirin Elsinghorst</a>
<br>
<p>This app uses <a href="https://www.who.int/childgrowth/en/">WHO Child Growth Standards</a>.</p>
<p>A description of this app can be found <a href="https://shirinsplayground.netlify.com/2020/09/baby_weight_app/">on my blog.</a></p>
<p>The code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ShirinG/who_baby_weight_app">Github.</a></p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not a healthcare professional and this app is only meant to be used for the curious parent to see how their baby's weight matches with what the WHO considers the reference standards. If you are unsure about the weight gain and health of your baby, please talk to your pediatrician, midwife or lactation specialist!</p>
